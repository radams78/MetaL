We show that there is a Stone-type duality between the usual state-transformer semantics and the weakest precondition semantics. Rather than trying to reduce quantum computation to probabilistic programming, we develop a notion that is directly taken from concepts used in quantum computation. The proof that weakest preconditions exist for completely positive maps follows immediately from the Kraus representation theorem. As an example, we give the semantics of Selinger’s language in terms of our weakest preconditions. We also cover some specific situations and exhibit an interesting link with stabilisers.},

To make the idea precise we need a generic notion of a data type, which leads to the notion of a container, introduced in (Abbott, Altenkirch, and Ghani, 2003a) and investigated extensively in (Abbott, 2003). Using containers we can provide a notion of linear map which is the concept missing from McBride’s first analysis. We verify the usual laws of differential calculus including the chain rule and establish laws for initial algebras and terminal coalgebras.},

  Abstract                 = {We use the mathematical language of sheaf theory to give a unified treatment of non-locality and contextuality, in a setting that generalizes the familiar probability tables used in non-locality theory to arbitrary measurement covers; this includes Kochen–Specker configurations and more. We show that contextuality, and non-locality as a special case, correspond exactly to obstructions to the existence of global sections. We describe a linear algebraic approach to computing these obstructions, which allows a systematic treatment of arguments for non-locality and contextuality. We distinguish a proper hierarchy of strengths of no-go theorems, and show that three leading examples—due to Bell, Hardy and Greenberger, Horne and Zeilinger, respectively—occupy successively higher levels of this hierarchy. A general correspondence is shown between the existence of local hidden-variable realizations using negative probabilities, and no-signalling; this is based on a result showing that the linear subspaces generated by the non-contextual and no-signalling models, over an arbitrary measurement cover, coincide. Maximal non-locality is generalized to maximal contextuality, and characterized in purely qualitative terms, as the non-existence of global sections in the support. A general setting is developed for the Kochen–Specker-type results, as generic, model- independent proofs of maximal contextuality, and a new combinatorial condition is given, which generalizes the ‘parity proofs’ commonly found in the literature. We also show how our abstract setting can be represented in quantum mechanics. This leads to a strengthening of the usual no-signalling theorem, which shows that quantum mechanics obeys no-signalling for arbitrary families of commuting observables, not just those represented on different factors of a tensor product.},

  Abstract                 = {Contextuality is a key feature of quantum mechanics that provides an important non-classical resource for quantum information and computation. Abramsky and Brandenburger used sheaf theory to give a general treatment of contextuality in quantum theory \cite{Abramsky2011}. However, contextual phenomena are found in other fields as well, for example database theory. In this paper, we shall develop this unified view of contextuality. We provide two main contributions: firstly, we expose a remarkable connection between contexuality and logical paradoxes; secondly, we show that an important class of contextuality arguments has a topological origin. More specifically, we show that "All-vs-Nothing" proofs of contextuality are witnessed by cohomological obstructions.},

  Abstract                 = {Bell inequalities play a central role in the study of quantum nonlocality and entanglement, with many applications in quantum information. Despite the huge literature on Bell inequalities, it is not easy to find a clear conceptual answer to what a Bell inequality is, or a clear guiding principle as to how they may be derived. In this paper, we introduce a notion of logical Bell inequality which can be used to systematically derive testable inequalities for a very wide variety of situations. There is a single clear conceptual principle, based on purely logical consistency conditions, which underlies our notion of logical Bell inequalities. We show that in a precise sense, all Bell inequalities can be taken to be of this form. Our approach is very general. It applies directly to any family of sets of commuting observables. Thus it covers not only the n-partite scenarios to which Bell inequalities are standardly applied, but also Kochen-Specker configurations, and many other examples. There is much current work on experimental tests for contextuality. Our approach directly yields, in a systematic fashion, testable inequalities for a very general notion of contextuality. There has been much work on obtaining proofs of Bell's theorem “without inequalities” or “without probabilities.” These proofs are seen as being in a sense more definitive and logically robust than the inequality-based proofs. On the hand, they lack the fault-tolerant aspect of inequalities. Our approach reconciles these aspects, and in fact shows how the logical robustness can be converted into systematic, general derivations of inequalities with provable violations. Moreover, the kind of strong non-locality or contextuality exhibited by the GHZ argument or by Kochen-Specker configurations can be shown to lead to maximal violations of the corresponding logical Bell inequalities. Thus the qualitative and the quantitative aspects are combined harmoniously.},

We show how sheaf the- ory can model the contextual nature of natural language and how gluing can be used to provide a global semantics for a discourse by putting to- gether the local logical semantics of each sentence within the discourse. We introduce a presheaf structure corresponding to a basic form of Dis- course Representation Structures. Within this setting, we formulate a notion of semantic unification — gluing meanings of parts of a discourse into a coherent whole — as a form of sheaf-theoretic gluing. We illus- trate this idea with a number of examples where it can used to represent resolutions of anaphoric references. We also discuss multivalued gluing, described using a distributions functor, which can be used to represent situations where multiple gluings are possible, and where we may need to rank them using quantitative measures.},

This does not seem to be true for the usual frameworks and so this is the reason for introducing yet another framework. Because of our focus on type theories we will call our framework T F ; i.e. a type framework. We will also be interested in an expansion of the framework T F to a frame- work T F L that will allow the representation of predicate logic on top of any type theory represented in T F .},

QML integrates reversible and irreversible quantum computations in one language, using first order strict linear logic to make weakenings explicit.

  Abstract                 = {This paper has something new and positive to say about propo- sitional equality in programming and proof systems based on the Curry-Howard correspondence between propositions and types. We have found a way to present a propositional equality type • which is substitutive, allowing us to reason by replacing equal for equal in propositions; • which reflects the observable behaviour of values rather than their construction: in particular, we have extensionality— functions are equal if they take equal inputs to equal outputs; • which retains strong normalisation, decidable typechecking and canonicity—the property that closed normal forms inhabiting datatypes have canonical constructors; • which allows inductive data structures to be expressed in terms of a standard characterisation of well-founded trees; • which is presented syntactically—you can implement it di- rectly, and we are doing so—this approach stands at the core of Epigram 2; • which you can play with now: we have simulated our system by a shallow embedding in Agda 2, shipping as part of the standard examples package for that system [21]. Until now, it has always been necessary to sacrifice some of these aspects. The closest attempt in the literature is Al- tenkirch’s construction of a setoid-model for a system with canon- icity and extensionality on top of an intensional type theory with proof-irrelevant propositions [4]. Our new proposal simplifies Al- tenkirch’s construction by adopting McBride’s heterogeneous ap- proach to equality [19].},

  Abstract                 = {Perception is the recognition of elements and events in the environment, usually through integration of sensory impressions. It is considered here as a broad, high-level, concept (different from the sensein which computer vision/audio research takes the concept of perception). We proose and develop premises for a formal approach to a fundamental phenomenon in AI: the diversit of artificial perceptions. A mathematical substratum is proposed as a basis for a rigorous theory of artificial perceptions. A basic mathematical category is defined. Its objects are \emph{perceptions}, consisting of \emph{world elements}, \emph{connotations}, and a three-valued ($true$, $false$, $undefined$) predicative correspondence between them. Morhisms describe paths between perceptions. This structure serves as a basis for a mathematical theory. This theory provides a way of extending and systematizing certain intuitive pre-theoretical conceptions about perception, about improving and/or completing an agent's perceptual grasp, about transition between various perceptions, etc. Some example applications of the theory are analyzed.},

By bringing these areas together we explain the basic ingredients of Dynamic Quantum Logic, a new direction of research in the logical foundations of physics.},

  Abstract                 = {We address the old question whether a logical understanding of Quan- tum Mechanics requires abandoning some of the principles of classical logic. Against Putnam and others (Among whom we may count or not E. W. Beth, depending on how we interpret some of his statements), our answer is a clear “no”. Philosophi- cally, our argument is based on combining a formal semantic approach, in the spirit of E. W. Beth’s proposal of applying Tarski’s semantical methods to the analysis of physical theories, with an empirical–experimental approach to Logic, as advo- cated by both Beth and Putnam, but understood by us in the view of the operational- realistic tradition of Jauch and Piron, i.e. as an investigation of “the logic of yes–no experiments” (or “questions”). Technically, we use the recently-developed setting of Quantum Dynamic Logic (Baltag and Smets 2005, 2008) to make explicit the opera- tional meaning of quantum-mechanical concepts in our formal semantics. Based on our recent results (Baltag and Smets 2005), we show that the correct interpretation of quan- tum-logical connectives is dynamical, rather than purely propositional. We conclude that there is no contradiction between classical logic and (our dynamic reinterpretation of) quantum logic. Moreover, we argue that the Dynamic-Logical perspective leads to a better and deeper understanding of the “non-classicality” of quantum behavior than any perspective based on static Propositional Logic.},

We also prove Representation Theorems, showing these axiomatizations to be complete with respect to the natural Hilbert-space semantics. The advantages of this setting are many: 1) it provides a clear and intuitive dynamic-operational meaning to key postu- lates (e.g. Orthomodularity, Covering Law); 2) it reduces the complexity of the Sol` er-Mayet axiomatization by replacing some of their key higher- order concepts (e.g. “automorphisms of the ortholattice”) by first-order objects (“actions”) in our structure ; 3) it provides a link between tradi- tional quantum logic and the needs of quantum computation.},

We extend that work here to a \emph{sound} (but not necessarily complete) logic for composite systems, which brings together ideas from the Quantum Logic tradition with concepts from (dynamic) Modal Logic and from Quantum Computation. This \emph{Logic of Quantum Programs (LQP)} is capable of expressing important features of quantum measurements and unitary evolutions of multi-partite states, as well as giving logical characterizations to various forms of entanglement (e.g. the Bell states, the $GHZ$ stats etc). We present a finitary syntax, a relational semantics and a sound proof system for this logic. As applications, we use our system to give formal correctness proofs for the Teleportation protocol and for a standard Quantum Secret Sharing protocol; a whole range of other quantum circuits and programs, including other known protocols (e.g. Superdense Coding, Entanglement Swapping, Logic-Gate Teleportation etc.), can be similarly verified using our logic.},

LLF combines the expressive power of dependent types with linear logic to permit the natural and concise representation of a whole new class of deductive systems, namely those dealing with state. As an example we encode a version of Mini-ML with references including its type system, its operational semantics, and a proof of type preservation. Another example is the encoding of a sequent calculus for classical linear logic and its cut elimination theorem. LLF can also be given an operational interpretation as a logic programming language under which the representations above can be used for type inference, evaluation and cut-elimination. 1 Introduction A logical framework is a formal system desig...}

  Abstract                 = {We show that quantum theory allows for transformations of black boxes that cannot be realized by inserting the input black boxes within a circuit in a pre-defined causal order. The simplest example of such a transformation is the classical switch of black boxes, where two input black boxes are arranged in two different orders conditionally on the value of a classical bit. The quantum version of this transformation—the quantum switch—produces an output circuit where the order of the connections is controlled by a quantum bit, which becomes entangled with the circuit structure. Simulating these transformations in a circuit with fixed causal structure requires either postselection, or an extra query to the input black boxes.},

This equivalence involves on the one hand effectuses, which are categories for total computation, introduced by Jacobs for the study of quantum/effect logic. On the other hand, it involves what we call FinPACs with effects; they are finitely partially additive categories equipped with effect algebra structures, serving as categories for partial computation. It turns out that the Kleisli category of the lift monad (−) + 1 on an effectus is always a FinPAC with effects, and this construction gives rise to the equivalence. Additionally, state-and-effect triangles over FinPACs with effects are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {Operator algebras, specifically C ∗ -algebras and W ∗ -algebras (the latter are also known as von Neumann algebras), give a formulation for quantum theory that is alternative to the one by Hilbert spaces. They are successfully used in areas such as quantum field theory and quantum information theory, yielding many notable results. It seems, how- ever, that the use of operator algebras is not common so far in the area of quantum computation. As an application of operator algebras to quantum computation, the present thesis gives a denotational semantics for a quantum programming language by operator alge- bras. We show that the opposite category of the category of W ∗ -algebras and normal completely positive pre-unital maps is an elementary quantum flow chart category in the sense of Selinger. As a consequence, Selinger’s quantum programming language QPL can be interpreted as a map between W ∗ -algebras.},

(ii) To axiomatise complementarity of quantum observables within a general framework for physical theories in terms of dagger symmetric monoidal categories. We also axiomatize phase shifts within this framework. Using the well-studied canonical correspondence between graphical calculi and dagger symmetric monoidal categories, our results provide a purely graphical formalisation of complementarity for quantum observables. Each individual observable, represented by a commutative special dagger Frobenius algebra, gives rise to an abelian group of phase shifts, which we call the phase group. We also identify a strong form of complementarity, satisfied by the Z and X spin observables, which yields a scaled variant of a bialgebra.},

  Abstract                 = {It is well known that the C$^*$-algebra of an ordered pair of qubits is $M_2 \otimes M_2$ . What about unordered pairs? We show in detail that $M_3 \oplus \mathbb{C}$ is the C$^*$-algebra of an unordered pair of qubits. Then we use Schur-Weyl duality to characterize the C$^*$-algebra of an unordered $n$-tuple of $d$-level quantum systems. Using some further elementary representation theory and number theory, we characterize the quantum cycles. We finish with a characterization of the von Neumann algebra for unordered words.},

  Abstract                 = {We define a language CQP (Communicating Quantum Processes) for modelling systems which combine quan- tum and classical communication and computation. CQP combines the communication primitives of the pi- calculus with primitives for measurement and transfor- mation of quantum state; in particular, quantum bits (qubits) can be transmitted from process to process along communication channels. CQP has a static type system which classifies channels, distinguishes between quantum and classical data, and controls the use of quantum state. We formally define the syntax, oper- ational semantics and type system of CQP, prove that the semantics preserves typing, and prove that typing guarantees that each qubit is owned by a unique process within a system. We illustrate CQP by defining models of several quantum communication systems, and outline our plans for using CQP as the foundation for formal analysis and verification of combined quantum and clas- sical systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Given an algebraic theory which can be described by a (possibly symmetric) operad P , we propose a definition of the weakening (or categorification) of the theory, in which equations that hold strictly for P-algebras hold only up to coherent isomorphism. This generalizes the theories of monoidal categories and symmetric monoidal categories, and several related notions defined in the literature. Using this definition, we generalize the result that every monoidal category is monoidally equivalent to a strict monoidal category, and show that the “strictification” functor has an interesting universal property, being left adjoint to the forgetful functor from the category of strict P-categories to the category of weak P-categories. We further show that the categorification obtained is independent of our choice of presentation for P, and extend some of our results to many-sorted theories, using multicategories.},

The properties of sequential products on Hilbert space effect algebras are discussed. For a general SEA, relationships between sequential independence, coexistence and compatibility are given. It is shown that the sharp elements of a SEA form an orthomodular poset. The sequential center of a SEA is discussed and a characterization of when the sequential center is isomorphic to a fuzzy set system is presented. It is shown that the existence, of a sequential product is a strong restriction that eliminates many effect algebras from being SEA's. For example, there are no finite nonboolean SEA's, A measure of sharpness called the sharpness index is studied. The existence of horizontal sums of SEA's is characterized and examples of horizontal sums and tensor products are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {There are several different approaches to the theory of data types. At the simplest level, polynomials and containers give a theory of data types as free standing entities. At a second level of complex- ity, dependent polynomials and indexed containers handle more sophis- ticated data types in which the data have an associated indices which can be used to store important computational information. The crucial and salient feature of dependent polynomials and indexed containers is that the index types are defined in advance of the data. At the most so- phisticated level, induction-recursion allows us to define data and indices simultaneously. This work investigates the relationship between the theory of small inductive recursive definitions and the theory of dependent polynomials and indexed containers. Our central result is that the expressiveness of small inductive recursive definitions is exactly the same as that of dependent polynomials and indexed containers. A second contribution of this paper is the definition of morphisms of small inductive recursive definitions. This allows us to extend our main result to an equivalence between the category of small inductive recursive definitions and the category of dependent polynomials/indexed containers. We comment on both the theoretical and practical ramifications of this result.},

  Abstract                 = {The scheme of quantum teleportation, where Bob has multiple (N) output ports and obtains the teleported state by simply selecting one of the N ports, is thoroughly studied. We consider both the deterministic version and the probabilistic version of the teleportation scheme aiming to teleport an unknown state of a qubit. Moreover, we consider two cases for each version: (i) the state employed for the teleportation is fixed to a maximally entangled state, and (ii) the state is also optimized as well as Alice's measurement. We analytically determine the optimal protocols for all the four cases, and show the corresponding optimal fidelity or optimal success probability. All these protocols can achieve the perfect teleportation in the asymptotic limit of N -> infinity. The entanglement properties of the teleportation scheme are also discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {In the semantics of programming languages one can view programs as state transformers, or as predicate transformers. Recently the author has introduced `state-and-effect' triangles which captures this situation categorically, involving an adjunction between state- and predicate-transformers. The current paper exploits a classical result in category theory, part of Jon Beck's monadicity theorem, to systematically construct such a state-and-effect triangle from an adjunction. The power of this construction is illustrated in many examples, both for the Boolean and probabilistic (quantitative) case.},

  Abstract                 = {Traditionally in categorical logic predicates on an object/type X are represented as subobjects of X. Here we break with that tradition and use maps of the form p : X → X + X with [id, id] ◦ p = id as predicates. This new view gives a more dynamic, measurement-oriented view on predicates, that works well especially in a quantitative setting. In classical logic (in the category of sets) these new predicates coincide with the traditional ones (subsets, or characteristic maps X → {0, 1}); in probabilistic logic (in the category of sets and stochastic matrices), the new predicates correspond to fuzzy predicates X → [0, 1]; and in quantum logic (in Hilbert spaces) they correspond to effects (positive endomaps below the identity), which may be understood as fuzzy predicates on a changed basis. It is shown that, under certain conditions about coproducts +, predicates p : X → X + X form effect algebras and carry a scalar multiplication (with probabili- ties). Suitable substitution functors give rise to indexed/fibred categories. In the quantum case the famous Born rule — describing the probability of observation outcomes — follows directly from the form of these substitution functors: prob- ability calculation becomes substitution in predicate logic. Moreover, the char- acteristic maps associated with predicates provide tests in a dynamic logic, and turn out to capture measurement in a form that uniformly covers the classical, probabilistic and quantum case. The probabilities incorporated in predicates (as eigenvalues) serves as weights for the possible measurement outcomes.},

  Abstract                 = {So-called effect algebras and modules are basic mathematical structures that were first identified in mathematical physics, for the study of quantum logic and quantum probability. They incorporate a double negation law p⊥⊥ = p. Since then it has been realised that these effect structures form a useful abstraction that covers not only quantum logic, but also Boolean logic and probabilistic logic. Moreover, the duality between effect and convex structures lies at the heart of the duality between predicates and states. These insights are leading to a uniform framework for the semantics of computation and logic. This framework has been elaborated elsewhere for set- theoretic, discrete probabilistic, and quantum computation. Here the missing case of continuous probability is shown to fit in the same uniform framework. On a technical level, this involves an investigation of the logical aspects of the Giry monad on measurable spaces and of Lebesgue integration},

We construct a concrete deno- tational semantics of Selinger and Valiron’s quantum lambda calcu- lus, which was previously an open problem. We do this by considering presheaves over appropriate base categories arising from first-order quan- tum computation. The main technical ingredients are Day’s convolution theory and Kelly and Freyd’s notion of continuity of functors. We first give an abstract description of the properties required of the base cat- egories for the model construction to work. We then exhibit a specific example of base categories satisfying these properties.},

  Abstract                 = {Tagless interpreters for well-typed terms in some object language are a standard example of the power and benefit of precise indexing in types, whether with dependent types, or generalized algebraic datatypes. The key is to reflect object language types as indices (however they may be constituted) for the term datatype in the host language, so that host type coincidence ensures object type coinci- dence. Whilst this technique is widespread for simply typed object languages, dependent types have proved a tougher nut with nontriv- ial computation in type equality. In their type-safe representations, Danielsson [2006] and Chapman [2009] succeed in capturing the equality rules, but at the cost of representing equality derivations explicitly within terms. This article delivers a type-safe represen- tation for a dependently typed object language, dubbed K IPLING, whose computational type equality just appropriates that of its host, Agda. The K IPLING interpreter example is not merely de rigeur— it is key to the construction. At the heart of the technique is that key component of generic programming, the universe.},

  Abstract                 = {Pattern matching has proved an extremely powerful and durable notion in functional programming. This paper contributes a new programming notation for type theory which elaborates the notion in various ways. Firstly, as is by now quite well-known in the type theory community, definition by pattern matching becomes a more discriminating tool in the presence of dependent types, since it refines the explanation of types as well as values. This becomes all the more true in the presence of the rich class of datatypes known as inductive families (Dybjer, 1991). Secondly, as proposed by Peyton Jones (Peyton Jones, 1997) for Haskell, and independently rediscovered by us, subsidiary case analyses on the results of intermediate computations, which commonly take place on the right-hand side of definitions by pattern matching, should rather be handled on the left. In simply-typed languages, this subsumes the trivial case of Boolean guards; in our setting it becomes yet more powerful. Thirdly, elementary pattern matching decompositions have a well-defined interface given by a dependetnt type; they correspond to the statement of an induction principle for the datatype. More general, user-definable decompositions may be defined which also have types of the same general form. Elementary pattern matching may therefore be recast in abstract form, with a semantics given by translation. Such abstract decompositions of data generalize Wadler's notion of 'view' (Wadler, 1987). The programmer whishing to introduce a new view of a type T, and exploit it directly in pattern matching, may do so via a standard programming idiom. The type theorist, looking through the Curry-Howard lens, may see this as proving a theorem, one which establishes the validity of a new induction principle for T. We develop enough syntax and semantics to account for this high-level style of programming in dependent type theory. It culminates in the development of a typechecker for the simply-typed lambda calculus, which furnishes a view of raw terms as either being well-typed, or containing an error. The implementation of this view is ipso facto a proof that typechecking is decidable.},

  Title                    = {A Galois Connection between Classical and Intuitionistic Logic},

  Author                   = {Sergey A. Melikhov},
  HowPublished             = {arXiv},

  Abstract                 = {In a 1985 commentary to his collected works, Kolmogoroff remarked that his 1932 paper "was written in hope that with time, the logic of solution of problems will become a permanent part of the logical curriculum. Creation of a unified logical apparatus dealing with objects of two types - propositions and problems - was intended." We construct such a formal system QHC, which is a conservative extension of both the intuitionistic predicate calculus QH and the classical predicate calculus QC, and sheds new light on the basics of intuitionism: 1) The only new connectives ? and ! of QHC induce a Galois connection (i.e., a pair of adjoint functors) between the Lindenbaum algebras of QH and QC. 2) Kolmogoroff's double negation translation of QC into QH extends to an interpretation of QHC in QH that is the identity on QH. 3) Goedel's provability translation of QH into the classical modal logic QS4 extends to an interpretation of QHC in QS4, which is identified with a fragment of QHC. Some models of QHC are constructed, including a sheaf-valued model inspired by dependent type theory, which appears to be of interest even as a model of QH (not to be confused with the well-known open-set-valued sheaf models of QH), since it can be seen as a rather accurate formalization of the BHK interpretation of intuitionistism. The paper is addressed to a general mathematical audience and includes a rather unconventional introduction to intuitionistic logic, featuring (a) a motivation via Hilbert's 24th Problem and Lafont's observation that in classical logic, any two proofs of a given theorem are "homotopic"; (b) a derivation of Tarski topological models of QH via a model in "Venn diagrams" of a classical first-order theory extracted from the clauses of the BHK interpretation.},

  Abstract                 = {Although type reconstruction for dependently typed languages is common in practical systems, it is still ill-understood. Detailed descriptions of the issues around it are hard to find and formal descriptions together with correctness proofs are non-existing. In this paper, we discuss a one-pass type reconstruction for objects in the logical framework LF, describe formally the type reconstruction process using the framework of contextual modal types, and prove correctness of type reconstruction. Since type reconstruction will find the most general types and may leave free variables, we in addition describe abstraction which will return a closed object where all free variables are bound at the outside. We also implemented our algorithms as part of the Beluga language, and the performance of our type reconstruction algorithm is comparable to type reconstruction in existing systems such as the logical framework Twelf.},

  Abstract                 = {Λμ-calculus was introduced as a Böhm-complete extension of Parigot’s λμ-calculus. Λμ-calculus, contrarily to Parigot’s calculus, is a calculus of CBN delimited control as evidenced by Herbelin and Ghilezan. In their seminal paper on (CBV) delimited control, Danvy and Filinski introduced the CPS Hierarchy of control operators (shift i /reset i ) i ∈ ω . In a similar way, we introduce in the present paper the Stream Hierarchy, a hierarchy of calculi extending and generalizing Λμ-calculus. The (Λn)n∈ω -calculi have Church-Rosser and Böhm theorems. We then present sound and complete CPS translations for the hierarchy. Next, we investigate the operational content of the hierarchy through its abstract machines, the (Λn)n∈ω -KAM. Finally, we establish that the Stream hierarchy is indeed a CBN analogue to the CPS hierarchy.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose the design of a programming language for quantum computing. Traditionally, quantum algorithms are frequently expressed at the hardware level, for instance in terms of the quantum circuit model or quantum Turing machines. These approaches do not encourage structured programming or abstractions such as data types. In this paper, we describe the syntax and semantics of a simple quantum programming language with high-level features such as loops, recursive procedures, and structured data types. The language is functional in nature, statically typed, free of run-time errors, and it has an interesting denotational semantics in terms of complete partial orders of superoperators.},

  Abstract                 = {We give an overview over the historic development of proof theory and the main techniques used in ordinal theoretic proof theory. We argue, that in a revised Hilbert’s program, ordinal theoretic proof theory has to be supplemented by a second step, namely the development of strong equiconsistent constructive theories. Then we show, how, as part of such a programe, the proof theoretic analysis of Martin-Löf type theory with W-type and one microscopic universe containing only two finite sets is carried out. Then we look at the analysis Martin-Löf type theory with W-type and a universe closed under the W-type, and consider the extension of type theory by one Mahlo universe and its proof-theoretic analysis. Finally, we repeat the concept of inductive-recursive definitions, which extends the notion of inductive definitions substantially. We introduce a closed formalization, which can be used in generic programming, and explain, what is known about its strength. Haut de page Entrées d'index},

  Abstract                 = {We construct a new model category presenting the homotopy the- ory of presheaves on “inverse EI (∞, 1)-categories”, which contains universe objects that satisfy Voevodsky’s univalence axiom. In addition to diagrams on ordinary inverse categories, as considered in previous work of the author, this includes a new model for equivariant algebraic topology with a compact Lie group of equivariance. Thus, it offers the potential for applications of homotopy type theory to equivariant homotopy theory.},

In this paper we start with an ef- fect algebraic approach to the study of non-locality and contextuality. We will see how different slices over the category of set valued functors on the natural numbers induce different settings in which non-locality and contextuality can be studied. This includes the Bell, Hardy and Kochen-Specker-type paradoxes. We link this to earlier sheaf theoretic approaches by defining a fully faithful embedding of the category of effect algebras in this presheaf category over the natural numbers.},

  Abstract                 = {This thesis is concerned with the extension of the Curry-Howard Correspondence to clas- sical logic. Although much progress has been made in this area since the seminal paper by Griffin, we believe that the question of finding canonical calculi corresponding to classical logics has not yet been resolved. We examine computational interpretations of classical logics which we keep as close as possible to Gentzen’s original systems, equipped with general notions of reduction. We present a calculus X i which is based on classical sequent calculus and the strongly- normalising cut-elimination procedure defined by Christian Urban. We examine how the notion of shallow polymorphism a ` la ML can be adapted to this calculus. We show that the intuitive adaptation of these ideas fails to be sound, and give a novel solution. In the setting of classical natural deduction, we examine the λμ-calculus of Parigot. We show that the underlying logic is incomplete in various ways, compared with a standard Gentzen-style presentation of classical natural deduction. We relax the identified restric- tions, yielding a richer calculus (νλμ) with a new kind of binding explicitly representing first-class continuations. We examine the relationship between various existing control operators in the literature and the νλμ-calculus. We show that the μ-binding, along with our generalised reduction rules, performs the role of a delimited control operator. We define a mapping from X i to νλμ, preserving typings and reductions. We believe this is the first time a general notion of cut-elimination for classical sequent calculus has been encoded into a calculus based on a Gentzen-style presentation of classical natural deduction. This encoding allows various of our results from the previous chapters to be adapted from one paradigm to the other.},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce an algebra qCCS of pure quantum processes in which communications by moving quantum states physically are allowed and computations are modeled by super-operators, but no classical data is explicitly involved. An operational semantics of qCCS is presented in terms of (nonprobabilistic) labeled transition systems. Strong bisimulation between processes modeled in qCCS is defined, and its fundamental algebraic properties are established, including uniqueness of the solutions of recursive equations. To model sequential computation in qCCS, a reduction re- lation between processes is defined. By combining reduction relation and strong bisimulation we introduce the notion of strong reduction-bisimulation, which is a device for observing interaction of computation and communication in quantum systems. Finally, a notion of strong approximate bisimulation (equivalently, strong bisimulation distance) and its reduction counterpart are intro- duced. It is proved that both approximate bisimilarity and approximate reduction-bisimilarity are preserved by various constructors of quantum processes. This provides us with a formal tool for observing robustness of quantum processes against inaccuracy in the implementation of its ele- mentary gates.},
